Hiring Decisions

{{ block content }}
<p> The results of the sequences task you have just completed can be used for another round of hiring decisions.
    Your and your opponent's performance will then be displayed to the same employers as before, so they can make another hiring decision between you and your opponent
    based on that additional information.
</p>

<p>
     As in Part I, you can earn money through that decision.
     You will receive a bonus payment of {{C.bonushired}} if the majority of the employers selects you in this second selection round. This means that
     you get the bonus if more than {{C.bonus_threshold}} employers select you. If exactly {{C.bonus_threshold}} of the {{C.number_employers}}
     employers hire you, whether or not you get the bonus will be decided by a virtual coin flip.
</p>

<p> In case you do not want to participate in another hiring decision, we give you the option to not participate.
    Choosing that option means that the employers in the hiring decision will <b> not </b> see your profile and score and will
    make no decision about whether to select you or your opponent.
    Thus, you can also not be hired and therefore not receive any bonus money for the hiring decision.
    (If you decided to drop out and your opponent decides to join this second round of hiring, your opponent will get the bonus payment.
    If they also decide to drop out, nobody gets a bonus payment.)
    Of course, for the sequences task you just performed, you will still get the bonus payment according to the explained mechanism.
