<h5> Your Task: </h5>
<p>
    You are now asked to complete another sequences task. The task is similar to the one in Part I.
    You will again have {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes to complete {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}} sequences. The sequences are at the same
    difficulty level as the ones in Part I.
</p>
<!-- <p> The employers that have made the selection decision between you and the other worker in the first stage of the other experiment
    will afterwards be informed about your
    and the other worker's performance in the upcoming sequences task. Based on that information, they decide again
    whether to hire you or the other worker. They will receive money if they choose the worker with the higher score.
</p>
-->
<h5> Your Bonus Payment: </h5>
<p> As in the Part I, you will again have the opportunity to earn a bonus payment.
    The bonus will be determined by the same mechanism as in the Part I. Thus, you will again be asked to set a target number of points
    and get a bonus payment depending on the target score and whether or not reach or exceed it.  </p>
</p>
<!--
<h5> Option: </h5>
<p> Before the next sequences task starts, you have the opportunity to not participate in the second hiring decision.
    Choosing the option to not participate in the hiring decision means that you do the sequences task regularily and receive bonus money according
    to the explained mechanism. In the hiring decision afterwards, however, the employers will <b> not </b> see your profile and score. Thus,
    you can also not be hired and therefore not receive any bonus money for the hiring decision.
