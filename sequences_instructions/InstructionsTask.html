    <h5> <b> Your Task: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        In this part you are asked to complete sequences of numbers.
        In particular, you have {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes, to solve as many sequences as possible.
        In order to find the missing number of a sequence, you need to figure out the pattern according to which the number sequence is constructed.
        The task ends either after {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes or after you have completed all {{C.num_sequences_task}} sequences.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
<table class="center">
    <tr>
        <td style="font-size:30px; width:70"> 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ,  </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td style="width:50px">
            <input type="number" min="0" name="input_sequence" id="input_sequence" class="form-control" readonly>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
    <p>
        In this example, the rule according to which the sequence of numbers is constructed is to subtract 1 from the previous number in the sequence.
        Therefore, the correct answer would be "5".
    </p>
    <p>
        You can always skip a sequence by clicking on "Next". In that case you will be directed to the next sequence.
        Please note that you can never go back to a previous question.
        Instead of clicking "Next" you can also press "enter" to submit your answer and move on to the next sequence.
    </p>
    <h5> <b> Your Bonus Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        The bonus payment for the task depends on a self-set target score as well as your performance in this task.
        Before the task starts, you are asked to set yourself a target score (i.e. how many sequences you will solve correctly) between 0 and {{C.num_sequences_task}}.
        You will afterwards receive a bonus payment that corresponds to your target score times {{ C.bonusfactor }}, but only if you actually reach that target, i.e., if you solve at least as many sequences correctly as you have specified as your target before.
        This means, the higher you set your target, the higher is your possible bonus payment.
        However, setting a high target also increases the likelihood that you do not reach your target and hence earn no bonus payment at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Three Examples:</b><br>
        a) You set a target score of {{ C.bonusexample1 }} and you manage to solve 15 sequences correctly: You get a bonus of {{ C.bonusexample1 }} * {{ C.bonusfactor }} = {{ C.bonusexample1_comp_bonus }}. <br>
        b) You set a target score of {{ C.bonusexample2 }} and you manage to solve 15 sequences correctly: You get a no bonus.<br>
        c) You set a target score of {{ C.bonusexample2 }} and you manage to solve 45 sequences correctly: You get a bonus of {{ C.bonusexample2 }} * {{ C.bonusfactor }} = {{ C.bonusexample2_comp_bonus }}.

    </p>

<p>
    On the next page, you will be provided with a short trainings phase to get to know the task. In this practice round you have {{C.time_sequences_training}} seconds
    to complete a maximum of {{C.num_sequences_training}} sequences. The result of the trainings phase does not influence your payment.
    Afterwards you will get more information about the bonus payment for the task and will be asked to specify your self-set target score.
