<p> Out of the {{C.num_employers}} employers that were confronted with the decision between you and your competitor shown before
    the beginning of the main experiment,
     <b> {{ hiring_decision_pro }} </b> employer(s) selected you and <b> {{ hiring_decision_con }} </b> employer(s) selected your competitor.
    </p>

<p>

        {{ if hiring_decision_pro > hiring_decision_con }}
        This means that you earn additionally {{ bonus_pre_hiring }} for being selected by more than half of the employers for the task.
        {{ elif hiring_decision_pro < hiring_decision_con }}
        Since you were selected by less than half of the employers, you will <b> not </b> receive a bonus for that. (Test: {{ bonus_pre_hiring }})
        {{ elif hiring_decision_pro == hiring_decision_con }}
        Since exactly half of the employers selected you, we determined randomly whether you receive a bonus or not with the result
        of you getting {{ bonus_pre_hiring }}.
        {{ endif }}
