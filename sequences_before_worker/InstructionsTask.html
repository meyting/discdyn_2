    <h5> <b> Task: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        In the first part/ before the main part of the experiment starts, you are asked to answer up to {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }}
        questions consisting of a sequences of numbers within {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes.
        In order to find the missing number of a sequence, you need to figure out the pattern according to which the number sequence is constructed.
        The task ends either after {{C.time_sequence_mins}} minutes or after you have completed all {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}} sequences.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;"> <u> Example: </u>  </p>
<table class="center">
    <tr>
        <td style="font-size:30px; width:70"> 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ,  </td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td style="width:50px">
            <input type="number" min="0" name="input_sequence" id="input_sequence" class="form-control" readonly>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
    <p>
        In this example, the rule according to which the sequence of numbers is constructed is to subtract 1 from the previous number in the sequence.
        Therefore, the correct answer would be "5".
    </p>
    <p>
        You can always skip a sequence by clicking on "Next". In that case you will be directed to the next sequence.
        Please note that you can never go back to a previous question.
        Instead of clicking "Next" you can also press "enter" to submit your answer and move on to the next sequence.
    </p>
    <h5> <b> Payment: </b> </h5>
    <p>
        Your performance in this task determines your bonus payment for part I.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bonus payment for the task depends on a self-set target number of points. Before the task starts, you
        are asked to set yourself a target score between 0 and {{C.NUM_ROUNDS}}.
        You will afterwards receive a bonuspayment depending on the amount of that target score but only if you solve at least
        as many questions correctly as you have specified before.
    </p>

    <p> On the next pages, you will get more information about the bonus payment and will be asked to specify your self-set
        "target" score. </p>
    <br>

<p> On the next page, you can try the task in a short training phase. In this practice round you have {{C.time_sequences_training}} minute
    to complete {{C.num_sequences_training}} sequences. The result of the training phase does not influence your payment. </p>
