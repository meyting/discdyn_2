    Bonus Payment for the pre-experimental part

{{ block content }}
<p> As mentioned on the previous pages, you have the chance to earn a bonus payment for this pre-experimental part. The bonus depends on two factors: <br>
    <ul>
        <li> Below, you are asked to sepcify a target score for the task. If you reach at least this score, you get a fixed payment.
        This payment increases with the amount of your chosen target score: </li>
        <ul>
            <li> The fixed payment you receive when achieving your target corresponds to the number of points times {{ C.bonusfactor}}. </li>
            <li> Example: If you set yourself a goal of {{C.bonusexample_competition}}, the bonus you earn when solving
                at least {{C.bonusexample_competition}} questions correctly, will be
                {{C.bonusexample_competition}}* {{C.bonusfactor}} = {{C.bonusexample_comp_bonus}}. </li>
        </ul>
        <li> (Additionally, if you reach your target, you earn ... per correctly solved question?) </li>
    <li> This implies, in order to maximize your payoff, you should estimate your score as precisely as possible and
        try to solve as many questions as possible.</li>
    <li> If you have read and understood these explanations, please click "Next" to go to the next page to set your own target.
    </li>
    </ul>
